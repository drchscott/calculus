<div class="para">To move forward, let’s set down some language often used in optimization.  For us, it’s easiest to talk about this in the context of a function since generally we use functions to describe circumstances to which mathematics applies.  When we say *local* or alternatively *relative* maximum, we mean a value the function obtains at some location in its domain that is larger than or equal to any other value it obtains in some interval (possible a very small interval) containing the location.  In otherwords, the function is maximal at that point in that little neighborhood but might get bigger outside of the neighborhood.  Local / relative minimum is analogously defined.  When we say *global* or *absolute* maximum, we mean a value the function obtains at some location in its domain and that value is larger than or equal to any other value the function obtains in its domain.  Global / Absolute minimum is analogously defined.  When we say the function obtains an *optimum* or *extreme* value, we are just indicating that it obtains a max or min but aren’t specifying which one.  Let’s look at and example to practice the language.  Consider the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=2x^3-3x^2-12x+18\)</span> given below. <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-11.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> This function has domain <span class="process-math">\([-3,3]\text{.}\)</span>  You’ll notice that by the definitions given above it has a *local* min at 2.  Notice the language here.  There is a local min *at* 2.  That local min *is* <span class="process-math">\(-2=f(2)\text{.}\)</span>  Let’s explore further.  Can you find a global min?  What is it and where does it happen?  Well, yes ... there is one.  It happens *at* <span class="process-math">\(x=-3\)</span> and it *is* <span class="process-math">\(-28\)</span> (i.e. <span class="process-math">\(f(-3)\)</span>).  Okay, finish it out on your own.  Do you find any other extremes?  There are two more.  Can you say what they are and also where they occur?</div>
