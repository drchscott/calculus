<div class="para">But, sometimes equations can be very complicated and finding such explicit expressions for the function implied there just might not be possible.  So, suppose we pretend for a moment that we can’t solve <span class="process-math">\(x^2y=1\)</span> explicitly for <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>  I know, we can and we did just above.  But, play along like we can’t.  Is there nothing we can do to get information about <span class="process-math">\(y'\text{?}\)</span>  Well, there is.  Since you know that <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is *some* function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> that means that <span class="process-math">\(x^2y\)</span> is a product of two functions of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> (namely <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>)  We also know from previous sections how to differentiate a product.  So, differentiation both sides of the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^2y=1\)</span> gives <span class="process-math">\(2xy+x^2y'=0\text{.}\)</span>  Solving for <span class="process-math">\(y'\)</span> gives <span class="process-math">\(y'=-2xy/x^2=-2y/x\text{.}\)</span>  This doesn’t give <span class="process-math">\(y'\)</span> explicitly yet since we don’t know <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> explicitly yet.  But, if someone came along and told us that <span class="process-math">\(y=1/x^2\text{,}\)</span> notice that this conclusion gives us immediately that <span class="process-math">\(y'=-2/x^3\text{.}\)</span>
