<div class="para">The function we worked with in the previous section had both an absolute max and an absolute min.  So, is that true for every function?  Can you picture a function that doesn’t have an absolute max or an absolute min?  Consider this function defined on the closed interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
x \amp 0 \le x \le 1 \\
3-x \amp 1 \lt x \le 2
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Does this function have an absolute max?  Let’s plot it to see if we can understand the question better. <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-14.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> Now that we see its graph, what do you think?  Does it *obtain* an absolute max?  You might say, "Well, yeah. Isn’t it 2?  Right there at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{?}\)</span>"  But... no.  At <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> the value of the function is <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span>  It never actually obtains the value 2.  In fact, no matter where you evaluate this function, there are always larger values that the function obtains.  So, what went wrong?  A little thought leads us to conclude that it is that annoying discontinuity at 1 that is the problem.  So, maybe as long as a function is continuous, we can avoid situations where the function does not obtain its absolute max.  So, suppose we have *better* behaved, continuous function similar to the one we’re studying.  For example, suppose that we just use the nice continuous function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x\text{.}\)</span>  Now, that one is continous everywhere so it shouldn’t have a problem.  Right?  Not so fast.  Suppose we define it on the partially open interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2)\)</span> instead of the closed interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\text{.}\)</span>  Then we get this graph <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-15.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> Once again, we see that the function does not obtain an absolute maximum.  The problem this time is that the domain interval has that darned open end.  At this point, you may be thinking that there might be tons of ways a function could have problems that prevent extremes from being obtained.  Fortunately, that’s not really the case.  The two problems identified above are the only real issues.  In fact, we have ...</div>
