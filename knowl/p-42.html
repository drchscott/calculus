<div class="para">Consider this graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2\text{.}\)</span> <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-5.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> In addition to <span class="process-math">\(x^2\text{,}\)</span> a couple of lines are plotted here.  They both pass through the point <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> on the graph.  Notice that the black line is special in a particular way.  Namely, it just "touches" the graph at <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> without "cutting" through the graph.  If you used any other line passing touching <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> (i.e. touch <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> but use a different slope) like the dashed line, then it "cuts through".  You should recall from your precalculus experience that lines like the black one here are called "tangent" lines.  Tangent lines to graphs are very important to applied scientists such as physicists.  It would be nice to write an equation for this tangent line but you’ll notice that we can’t quite do that.  Why?  Well, after a little thought you hopefully realized that while we have a point that the line passes through <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\text{,}\)</span> we would need either another point the line passes through or the slope of the line in order to write an equation for it.  But, we have neither.  So, the tangent line is just an idea and not something we can concretely describe at this point.  Our goal is to solve this "tangent line problem" by finding a way to compute the slope of lines tangent to graphs so that we can write equations for them.</div>
