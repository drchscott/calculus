<div class="para">Our study of integrals was motivated by the area problem so it feels necessary to at least note that in a fairly broad sense, we’ve solved the area problem.  Consider, for example, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=x^3\text{.}\)</span>  Let’s graph them both together. <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-23.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> Take a look at that oddly shaped area trapped between the two curves.  Can we calculate that area?  Sure.  We have the skills now.  Notice that the area occurs over the interval <span class="process-math">\(0\le x \le 1\text{.}\)</span>  The curve on top is <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\text{,}\)</span> <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-24.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> An antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{x}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(2x^{3/2}/3\)</span> so that according to the FTC, the area under that curve is <span class="process-math">\(\int_0^1 \sqrt{x} dx = 2(1)^{3/2}/3 - 2(0)^{3/2}/3 = 2/3\text{.}\)</span>  The curve on the bottom is <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=x^3\text{,}\)</span> <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-25.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> An antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(x^3\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x^4/4\)</span> so that according to the FTC, the area under that curve is <span class="process-math">\(\int_0^1 x^3 dx = (1)^{4}/4 - (0)^{4}/4 = 1/4\text{.}\)</span>  So, the area trapped between is <span class="process-math">\(2/3-1/4 = 8/12 - 3/12 = 5/12\text{.}\)</span>  -- very quick to calculutate with the skills we now have.</div>
