<div class="para">We donâ€™t dwell much on proof in this text but, can you see the proof here?  When we use the name "corollary" for a mathematical statement, we are stating that the proof follows quickly from previous theorems.  Consequently, corollaries provide a gentle introduction to the idea of proof writing.  So, it seems appropriate at this stage to be, at least occasionally, discussing such proofs.  In this case, the corollary above follows quickly from the chain rule.  Why?  Notice that by the definition of inverse functions, we have that <span class="process-math">\(f(f^{-1}(x))=x\text{.}\)</span>  Now, use the chain rule to help with differentiating both sides of this equation and see what you get.</div>
