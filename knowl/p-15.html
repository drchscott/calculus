<div class="para">A careful observer will notice that in the previous sections, we only looked at a handful of domain values to essentially make a guess as to where the function is headed.  Consider, for example, our friend <span class="process-math">\(sin(x)/x\text{.}\)</span>  Look at the table we made at the beginning of the first section.  We stopped looking once we let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> get down to <span class="process-math">\(0.001\text{.}\)</span>  But what about even closer?  Like <span class="process-math">\(x=0.0003\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x=0.0000000162\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x=0.0000000000004\text{?}\)</span>  Maybe waaaay down there <span class="process-math">\(sin(x)/x\)</span> starts getting wonky.  Maybe.  So, right now we’re just guessing that <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0^{+}}(sin(x)/x)=1\text{.}\)</span>  Educated guessing ... yes.  But still just guessing.  We’d like to start moving past just guessing.  We start doing that in this section.  We start by looking at a couple of functions whose limits are not in question.</div>
