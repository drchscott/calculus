<div class="para">So... how?  How did historical mathematical luminaries such as Isaac Newton solve this tangent line problem?  Well, suppose for a moment that instead of looking at the tangent line, we look at a line passing through <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> and a point on the graph just a teensy bit to the right or left of <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\text{.}\)</span>  So, suppose <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is a teensy number.  We could adjust <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> by that amount and look up at the graph to the point <span class="process-math">\((1+h, f(1+h))\text{.}\)</span>  For example, we could take <span class="process-math">\(h=.75\)</span> giving us the point on the graph <span class="process-math">\((1.75,1.75^2)=(1.75,3.0625)\text{.}\)</span>  The line going through the two points <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1.75,1.75^2)=(1.75,3.0625)\)</span> has a slope (rise/run) equal to <span class="process-math">\((3.0625-1)/(1.75-1) = 2.75\)</span> (i.e. <span class="process-math">\((f(1+h)-f(1))/h\)</span>).  So, that line *can* be plotted since we have both a slope, <span class="process-math">\(2.75\)</span>), and a point the line passes through, <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\text{.}\)</span>  Here, let’s plot that line as a dashed line and show it along with the tangent line. <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-6.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> You’ll notice that while this dashed line is not quite the tangent line, it is ... close.  We could get even closer by choosing a point even closer to <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\text{.}\)</span>  In other words, make <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> smaller (either a teensier positive or negative number).  For smaller and smaller values of <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> the resulting lines should look more and more line the tangent line. For example, suppose we take <span class="process-math">\(h's\)</span> like <span class="process-math">\(.75, .5, .1,\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(.01\text{.}\)</span>  Those give lines with the following slopes</div>
