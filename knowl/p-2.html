<div class="para">The philosophy here is, in brief, that the core ideas of limit &gt; derivative &gt; integral are easy to understand and that understanding them happens for the largest audience by keeping the matter as direct and uncluttered as possible.  Further, anciliary concepts can be easily picked up once that core is in place and consequencly should not be presented initially since they clutter the presentation and produce possible distraction that reduces the chance that the critical core is understood.</div>
