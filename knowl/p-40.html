<div class="para">Recall the graph of this function from the first section of this chapter. <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-3.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> Notice that it has the value <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> (i.e. <span class="process-math">\(f(0)=0\)</span>) and it has the value <span class="process-math">\(1.5\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> (i.e. <span class="process-math">\(f(1)=1.5\)</span>).  But, does it ever have the value <span class="process-math">\(1.3\)</span> (i.e. is there a domain value <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=1.3\)</span>)?  Imagine a horizontal line on the graph at a height of <span class="process-math">\(1.3\)</span> and youâ€™ll see that the answer is "no".  So, why not?  What goes wrong that this function has the value <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1.5\)</span> but never not has the intermediate value <span class="process-math">\(1.3\text{?}\)</span>  Hopefully the answer is apparent.  Namely, the function has a discontinuity so there is a "break" / "jump" over some of the intermediate values like <span class="process-math">\(1.3\text{.}\)</span>  One of the nice properties of functions that are continuous on an interval of numbers (i.e. continous at every number in an interval) is that it obtains all of its intermediate values.  Specifically, we have the following theorem known by mathematicians as the "Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)".</div>
