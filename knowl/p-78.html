<div class="para">So, how does calculus help find these optimums?  Take a look at the graph above.  Consider the open interval from -1 to 2 (i.e. <span class="process-math">\((-1,2)\)</span>).  You’ll notice there are no optimums on that interval.  Indeed, if you look at any point on the graph in that interval you’ll see that there are larger values just to the left of it and smaller values just to the right of it.  If you haven’t looked ... look.  Look, for example, at <span class="process-math">\((1,5)=(1,f(1))\)</span> on the graph. <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-12.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> Look at the values of the function to the left and right of this point.  Like any other value of the function in this interval (from <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span>), the value of the function is *not* optimal in any way (i.e. it has larger results to the left and smaller ones to the right).  So, if we are looking for optimums, this interval can be ignored.  There are no optimums there.  Now, how could calculus help us spot this useless interval?  Do you see any calculus connection in this interval.  Here, let’s plot the tangent line at <span class="process-math">\((1,5)\)</span> in case the connection isn’t evident. <div class="image-box" style="width: 65%; margin-left: 17.5%; margin-right: 17.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/image-13.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> What do you notice about the slope of that tangent line?  Yes, it’s negative.  In other words, <span class="process-math">\(f'(1)\)</span> is negative.  In fact, you can see that the derivative (i.e. slopes of tangent lines) are negative in that entire subinterval from -1 to 2.  The derivative being negative there ensures that the function is strictly decreasing, always has negative slope and so the function can’t obtain an optimum there.  Similarly, you can see that the derivative is always positive from -3 to -1 so the function doesn’t have an optimum in that open interval and the derivative is always positive from 2 to 3 so there is no optimum in that open interval.  That quickly leaves only <span class="process-math">\(x=-3, -2, 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=3\)</span> as places where optimums can occur.  This leads to what we call a first derivative analysis theorem.</div>
