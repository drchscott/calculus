<div class="para">The goal of this text is to keep the calculus presentation as lean and clear as possible.  But, ultimately, I feel that some nod has to be given to seeing how the rest of the world ends up seeing value in calculus.  So, in this section let’s quit doing math for a bit and instead look at some other kind of work and see how it can benefit from calculus.  The general notion here is that of "modeling".  This sort of process is very natural for us humans.  The idea is that we have a problem in one sphere of interest and it turns out that we can create a version of that problem in some other sphere of interest -- think making maps of the world on paper so you can roll the world up and take it with you.  So, we’re taking the interest in travelling about the world and modeling it using paper and drawings.  In that way, we can work on travel problems by doing stuff with paper and such instead of actually being out there in the world moving around.  How useful the information is depends on how good the model is and how well we can work with it.  The development of math has substantially been driven by the fact that so many spheres of interest lend themselves to good mathematical models.</div>
