<div class="para">On the other hand, looking at the graph at the start of the section, if we had just defined that function to be <span class="process-math">\(f(1)=1\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\(f(1)=1.5\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> would have been continuous at <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and, as apparent from the graph, everywhere else between <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span>  Such discontinuities are often called "removable".  So, weâ€™d say that for the function at the start of the section, the discontinuity at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> is "removable".</div>
