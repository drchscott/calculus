<div class="para">So, those two examples don’t require the use of any of our new limit finding skills.  They are obvious from geometry.  But, In the previous section, we did some of these computations for <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2\text{.}\)</span>  Looking back, you’ll recall we found <span class="process-math">\(f'(1)=2\text{.}\)</span>  Even more, if you worked through the example there doing both of the given <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> values, you would have found that <span class="process-math">\(f'(-.5)=-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'(1.5)=3\text{.}\)</span>  So, based on those facts, can you speculate on a general expression for <span class="process-math">\((x^2)'\text{?}\)</span>  Well, let’s use our limit finding skills to compute <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> for a very broad range of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> values all at once.  So, suppose <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is, generically, a number in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2\text{.}\)</span>  Now,</div>
