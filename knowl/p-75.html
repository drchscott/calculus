<div class="para">Of course, it may never happen that you explicitly know what <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is so that getting an explicit description of <span class="process-math">\(y'\)</span> might not be possible.  So, does this mean we have no information about <span class="process-math">\(y'\text{?}\)</span> Quite the contrary.  Suppose for example that due to some physical knowledge of the situation represented by the equation, we knew that the function <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> had the value <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> (i.e. <span class="process-math">\(y(1)=1\)</span>).  Then the equation we found, <span class="process-math">\(y'=-2y/x\text{,}\)</span> tells us that <span class="process-math">\(y'(1)=-2(1)/1=-2\text{.}\)</span>  So, we know the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> even though we have no explicit formula helping us to graph <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span>  Now that we have the slope of the tangent line, <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> and the point on the graph it passes through, <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\text{,}\)</span> we can write an equation for the tangent line:</div>
