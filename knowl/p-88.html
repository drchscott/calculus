<div class="para">Now, we’re trying to deal with costs.  So, let’s make a function for cost based on our variable <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span>  We’ll do it in terms of cents since that is how the problem was described to us.  Well, the area of the top and bottom combined is <span class="process-math">\(2\pi r^2cm^2\text{.}\)</span>  Since the cost for those is 2 cents per <span class="process-math">\(cm^2\text{,}\)</span> we see that the top and bottom contribute <span class="process-math">\(4\pi r^2\)</span> cents to the cost.  Now, if you lay out the side of the cylinder flat, you see it is a rectangle with dimensions <span class="process-math">\(h=\frac{1000}{\pi r^2}\)</span> and circumference of the circle making the top and bottom of the cylinder, <span class="process-math">\(2\pi r\text{.}\)</span>  So, the area of the side of the cylinder is the product of those two dimensions giving an area of</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(2\pi r)(\frac{1000}{\pi r^2})cm^2 = \frac{2000}{r}cm^2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">That area only costs 1 cent per <span class="process-math">\(cm^2\)</span> so it contributes <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2000}{r}\)</span> cents to the cost.  Finally, we have a cost function.  Let’s denote cost with a <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> so that now we have</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C(r)=4\pi r^2 + \frac{2000}{r}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Even more, we know that the domain we want to use is any positive <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> (i.e. the open interval <span class="process-math">\((0,\infty)\)</span>).</div>
