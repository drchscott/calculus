        <p>The purpose of this text is to provide a distinctly lean presentation of traditional Calculus 1 material.</p>

        <p>The philosophy here is, in brief, that the core ideas of limit > derivative > integral are easy to understand and that understanding them happens for the largest audience by keeping the matter as direct and uncluttered as possible.  Further, anciliary concepts can be easily picked up once that core is in place and consequencly should not be presented initially since they clutter the presentation and produce possible distraction that reduces the chance that the critical core is understood. </p>

        <p>For future development, the plan is to flesh out the text by providing incremental introduction of Python / Sage coding so that students learn basic 3rd generation coding principles while also providing themselves the tools to visualize the core concepts in action via many of the powerful anciliary ideas including applications to many scientific disciplines</p>

      <p>Consider the function</p>
      <p><me>sin(x)/x</me></p>
      <p>Notice that this function can't be evaluated at x=0 (i.e. 0 is not in its domain.)  But, we could compute it for values of x *close* to 0.  For example, consider the following table for sin(x)/x.</p>

          </tabular>

      </p>
      <p>
        Look at this table.  As we move the <m>x</m> values closer to <m>0</m>, what are the <m>sin(x)/x</m> values getting closer to? It's apparent that as <m>x</m> approaches <m>0</m>, that <m>sin(x)/x</m> approaches <m>1</m>.  Of course, to be fair, at the moment we're only letting <m>x</m> approach <m>0</m> from the right hand (positive) side of <m>0</m>.  Let's create some notation to record this kind of information.
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="sideLimit">
        If <m>f(x)</m> approaches a number, say <m>l</m>, as <m>x</m> approaches a number <m>a</m> from its right hand side, then we write <md><mrow>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)=l</mrow></md> which is pronounced "The limit of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>l</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from the right".  We also say that <m>f(x)</m> has a right hand limit of <m>l</m> at <m>a</m>.  Analogously, If <m>f(x)</m> approaches a number, say <m>k</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from its <underline>left</underline> hand side, then we write <md><mrow>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)=k</mrow></md> which is pronounced "The limit of <m>f(x)</m> is <m>k</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m> from the left".  Again, we also say that <m>f(x)</m> has a left hand limit of <m>k</m> at <m>a</m>.
      </definition>
      <p>
        So now, with this new notation, it seems reasonable to write 
        <md><mrow>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0^{+}}(sin(x)/x)=1</mrow></md>
      </p>
      <remark>
        It is critical to note here that we are using the word "approach" in the definition above to indicate that we simply take values of the domain variable <m>x</m> *close* to <m>a</m> but not equal to it.  In computing limits, we do not use <m>x=a</m>.  We're just identifying what <m>f(x)</m> is becoming as <m>x</m> *approaches* <m>a</m>.  In fact, in many cases such as <m>sin(x)/x</m>, we can't even compute the function at <m>x=a=0</m>.
      </remark>

      <example>
        For <m>f(x)=sin(x)/x</m> from above, make a table like the one above but this time use 4 or 5 domain values approaching <m>0</m> from the left.  Use the notation from the definition above to write your conclusion about the left hand limit.
      </example>

      <p>
        Finally, since it will often be the case that both the left hand and right hand limit come out the same (but not always) for a function, we just drop the <m>+</m> and <m>-</m> in that case.  In other words ...
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="limit">
        In case both the left hand and right hand limit of a function are the same (i.e. <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)=\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)=l</m>), then we simply write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}f(x)=l</m> without any reference to <m>+</m> or <m>-</m>.  In this case we say that <m>f(x)</m> has a limit of <m>l</m> at <m>a</m>.
      </definition>

      <example>
        For <m>f(x)=|x|/x</m>, notice that once again <m>0</m> is not in its domain.  Make tables for left and right hand approaches to <m>0</m> and use proper notation as defined above to write your conclusions about right hand limit, left hand limit and limit.

        So, it's pretty apparent that as <m>x\to 0^{+}</m>, the function <m>1/x</m> isn't headed toward any number.  So, there is no limit.  Said differently, the right hand limit of <m>1/x</m>does not exist at <m>0</m>.  So, the limit notation we've created so far isn't useful.  However, it would be useful to record this information.  To do that, we write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0^{+}}f(x)=\infty</m>.  Please note here that this notation is *not* saying that a limit exists.  It just is language explaining *how* it doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <example>
        Make another table for <m>1/x</m> but this time with value of <m>x</m> approaching <m>0</m> from the left.  What do you see?  What is a reasonable way to use limit notation and the <m>\infty</m> symbol to express what you find?
      </example>
      <definition xml:id="defInfinityLimits1">
        When <m>f(x)</m> grows positively without bound as <m>x</m> goes to <m>a</m> from the right, we write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)=\infty</m>.  Also, when <m>f(x)</m> grows positively without bound as <m>x</m> goes to <m>a</m> from the left, we write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)=\infty</m>.   Similarly, when <m>f(x)</m> grows negatively without bound as <m>x</m> goes to <m>a</m> from the right, we write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)=-\infty</m> and when <m>f(x)</m> grows negatively without bound as <m>x</m> goes to <m>a</m> from the left, we write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)=-\infty</m>.  As with actual limits, if we omit the <m>+</m> and <m>-</m> then we are saying that the behavior is the same from both directions.
      </definition>
      <p>
        We also use the <m>\infty</m> symbol as a *place* to let the domain variable *approach*.  When we let <m>x</m> get arbitrarily positively large, we write <m>x \to \infty</m>  So, for example, consider our friend <m>1/x</m>.   If you make a table for this taking larger and larger positive values of <m>x</m>, you'll see that <m>1/x</m> approaches <m>0</m>.  So, in that case, we can write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to \infty}1/x=0</m>.
      </p>
      <example>
        Make another table for <m>1/x</m> but this time with value of <m>x</m> getting negatively large without bound (e.g. <m>-1, -10, -100, -1000, etc.</m>).  What do you see?  What is a reasonable way to use limit notation and the <m>\infty</m> symbol to express what you find?
      </example>
      <definition xml:id="defInfinityLimits2">
        To express a limit when we let the domain variable grow positively without bound, we write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to \infty}</m> and to express a limit when we let the domain variable grow negatively without bound, we write <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to -\infty}</m>.
      </definition>
      <example>
        Use limit notation and the infinity symbol to express what is happening to <m>x^2</m> as <m>x</m> grows positively without bound.

    <section xml:id="limitProps">
      <title>Limit Properties</title>
      <p>
        A careful observer will notice that in the previous sections, we only looked at a handful of domain values to essentially make a guess as to where the function is headed.  Consider, for example, our friend <m>sin(x)/x</m>.  Look at the table we made at the beginning of the first section.  We stopped looking once we let <m>x</m> get down to <m>0.001</m>.  But what about even closer?  Like <m>x=0.0003</m> or <m>x=0.0000000162</m> or <m>x=0.0000000000004</m>?  Maybe waaaay down there <m>sin(x)/x</m> starts getting wonky.  Maybe.  So, right now we're just guessing that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0^{+}}(sin(x)/x)=1</m>.  Educated guessing ... yes.  But still just guessing.  We'd like to start moving past just guessing.  We start doing that in this section.  We start by looking at a couple of functions whose limits are not in question.  
      </p>
      <p>
        First, consider a constant function like <m>f(x)=5</m>.  No matter what you put in for <m>x</m>, it gives us <m>5</m>.  So, there's no question what it's approaching regardless of where we let <m>x</m> go.  It's always giving <m>5</m>.  So, we have ...
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm-limitOfConstants">
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>f(x)</m> is constant, say <m>f(x)=k</m> for some number <m>k</m>, and <m>a</m> is any number, Then <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}f(x)=k</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        Secondly, consider the function <m>f(x)=x</m>.  Well, this function just does whatever <m>x</m> does.  So, where <m>x</m> goes, so does <m>f(x)=x</m>.  Thus, we have ...
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm-limitOfIdentity">
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>f(x)=x</m> and <m>a</m> is any number, Then <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}f(x)=a</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        It is our good fortune that limits behave according to the following theorem.
      </p>
      
      <theorem xml:id="thm-limitBasicProperties">
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}f(x)=l</m> and <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}g(x)=k</m> and <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are any two numbers and the right hand side of the following equalities are defined, Then <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}(rf(x)+sg(x))=rl+sk</m>, <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}(f(x)g(x))=lk</m>, and <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}(f(x)/g(x))=l/k</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <remark>
        It is also the case that if all of the <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}</m> are replaced with either <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{+}}</m> or <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a^{-}}</m>, then the theorem <xref ref="thm-limitBasicProperties"/> is still correct.
      </remark>
      <p>
        Often, people cite this basic properties theorem by saying, "the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, the limit of a product is the product of the limits, and the limit of a ratio is the ratio of the limits".
      </p>
      <remark>
        Please note that, from the conditions of the theorem, if the right hand side of any of the equalities in this theorem can not be computed, then the theorem is not making a statement (i.e. isn't valid, isn't a thing).  For example, if <m>k=0</m> in the theorem, then we certainly are not claiming that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}(f(x)/g(x))=l/k</m> since the right hand side of this equality is <m>l/0</m> which isn't even a thing to claim something is.
      </remark>
      <example>
        Use <xref ref="thm-limitBasicProperties"/> to compute <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 2}(x^2)</m>, <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to -1}(x^2+3x)</m>, and <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0}(x^2+3x)/(x+2)</m>.
      </example>

        Using <xref ref="thm-limitBasicProperties" />, we quickly deduce the following quick conclusions (called "corollaries" by mathematicians).

Even worse, if we chose to define a function that was <m>1/x</m> for all <m>x\ne 0</m> and set it to be *something* at <m>0</m>, there is nothing we could set it to in order to make it continuous since <m>1/x</m> has no limit at <m>0</m>.  So, this discontinuity at <m>0</m> is quite bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, looking at the graph at the start of the section, if we had just defined that function to be <m>f(1)=1</m> instead of <m>f(1)=1.5</m>, then <m>f</m> would have been continuous at <m>1</m> and, as apparent from the graph, everywhere else between <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>.  Such discontinuities are often called "removable".  So, we'd say that for the function at the start of the section, the discontinuity at <m>x=1</m> is "removable".

      <title>Basic Properties</title>
      <p>
        In light of the definition of continuity from the previous section, we see that <xref ref="limitCorollaries"/> and <xref ref="thm-AFewKnownLimits"/> are really saying ...
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm-AFewKnownContinuities">
        <statement>
          Rational functions, <m>e^x</m>, <m>ln(x)</m>, <m>sin(x)</m> and <m>cos(x)</m> are all continuous wherever they are defined.
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        The basic limit properties then yield the following
      </p>
      <corollary xml:id="cor-basicContinuityProps">
        <statement>
          If <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are both continuous at a given <m>x</m>, then <m>rf(x)+sg(x)</m> and <m>f(x)g(x)</m> are all continuous at that <m>x</m>.  Further, if also <m>g(x)\ne 0</m> then <m>f(x)/g(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x</m>.
        </statement>
      </corollary>
      <p>
        So, for example, if we want to calculate the limit of <m>tan(x)</m> at <m>7.2</m>, it's very easy since we know from the corollary above that <m>tan(x)</m>, which is simply <m>sin(x)/cos(x)</m> is continuous at <m>7.2</m>.  Thus
        <me>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 7.2}tan(x)=tan(7.2)</me>

        Recall the graph of this function from the first section of this chapter.
        <image width="65%">
            <sageplot>
              p1 = plot(x^2, x, 0, .99, color='black', ymax=2)
              p2 = plot(-x+2, x, 1.02, 2, color='black', ymax=2)
              pt1 = point((1, 1.5), rgbcolor='black', pointsize=30)
              pt2 = circle((1,1), 0.02, rgbcolor=(0,0,0))
              p1+p2+pt1+pt2
            </sageplot>
        </image>
        Notice that it has the value <m>0</m> at <m>0</m> (i.e. <m>f(0)=0</m>) and it has the value <m>1.5</m> at <m>1</m> (i.e. <m>f(1)=1.5</m>).  But, does it ever have the value <m>1.3</m> (i.e. is there a domain value <m>x</m> for which <m>f(x)=1.3</m>)?  Imagine a horizontal line on the graph at a height of <m>1.3</m> and you'll see that the answer is "no".  So, why not?  What goes wrong that this function has the value <m>0</m> and <m>1.5</m> but never not has the intermediate value <m>1.3</m>?  Hopefully the answer is apparent.  Namely, the function has a discontinuity so there is a "break" / "jump" over some of the intermediate values like <m>1.3</m>.  One of the nice properties of functions that are continuous on an interval of numbers (i.e. continous at every number in an interval) is that it obtains all of its intermediate values.  Specifically, we have the following theorem known by mathematicians as the "Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)".
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm-IVT">
        <statement>
          If <m>f</m> is continuous on an interval <m>I</m> (whether open, half open, or closed) and <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are two values that <m>f</m> obtains and finally <m>w</m> happens to be a number between (i.e. intermediate to) <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>, then there is some <m>x</m> in <m>I</m> so that <m>f(x)=w</m>.
        </statement>
      </theorem>
    <p>
      Consider for example the function above but this time defined with <m>f(1)=1</m>.  Here, let's plot it.
      <image width="65%">
        <sageplot>
          p1 = plot(x^2, x, 0, 1, color='black', ymax=2)
          p2 = plot(-x+2, x, 1, 2, color='black', ymax=2)
          pt1 = point((1, 1), rgbcolor='black', pointsize=30)
          p1+p2+pt1
        </sageplot>
      </image>
      Now, if you look at any two values the function obtains, you'll see that every value in between them is also obtained by the function.  In other words, point one finger at a number on the vertical axis that the function obtains and also point a finger at another number on the vertical axis that the function obtains and then consider any number in between.  Look over at the graph and you'll see that the function also obtains that value.  Why?  Well, we removed the disontinuity so now this function is continuous on the interval <m>I=[0,2]</m> so we have the IVT.
